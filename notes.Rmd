*My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the

filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath confounded

*Considering the Savior’s great promise for peace in this life and eternal life 
in the life to come, discipleship is a price worth paying. It is a price we cannot 
afford not to pay. By measure, the requirements of discipleship are much, much 
less than the promised blessings.*

*The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do.
Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our
thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times
we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you, which is why the
scriptures are replete with the Lord’s counsel: “Be of good cheer, and do not
fear.”*

*...Alma noted, “Time only is measured unto men.” Because speed is a measure of
distance over time, if time becomes less relevant, so does speed. Thus, in
eternal things, such as our ongoing progress in becoming like God, direction is
more important than speed. In the long run, the direction we are headed matters
much more than the rate at which we are moving.*

*And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their
afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of
the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and
deliver them out of bondage. And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon
your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you
are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me
hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my
people in their afflictions.*

*Obedience opens the door to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. And
the spiritual gifts and abilities activated by the power of the Holy Ghost
enable us to avoid deception—and to see, to feel, to know, to understand, and 
to remember things as they really are. You and I have been endowed with a greater
capacity for obedience precisely for these reasons.*

*I testify that his intelligence is vastly superior in every field to the very 
brightest mortals in those fields and that his intellect in scope and truth far 
exceeds all human intellects. I thank him for encapsulating that exquisite mind

“catch-me-if-you-can” kind, but a pleading and patient, “Come, follow me.”*
