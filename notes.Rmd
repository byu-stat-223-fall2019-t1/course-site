*My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the 
wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep. He hath 
filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath confounded 
mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me.*

*Considering the Savior’s great promise for peace in this life and eternal life 
in the life to come, discipleship is a price worth paying. It is a price we cannot 
afford not to pay. By measure, the requirements of discipleship are much, much 
less than the promised blessings.*

*The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do.
Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our
thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times
we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you, which is why the
scriptures are replete with the Lord’s counsel: “Be of good cheer, and do not
fear.”*

there. Faith trusts that God has great things in store for each of us and that
Christ truly is the “high priest of good things to come.”*

*...Alma noted, “Time only is measured unto men.” Because speed is a measure of
distance over time, if time becomes less relevant, so does speed. Thus, in
eternal things, such as our ongoing progress in becoming like God, direction is
more important than speed. In the long run, the direction we are headed matters
much more than the rate at which we are moving.*

*And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their
afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of
the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and
deliver them out of bondage. And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon
your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you
are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me
hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my
people in their afflictions.*

*Obedience opens the door to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. And
the spiritual gifts and abilities activated by the power of the Holy Ghost
enable us to avoid deception—and to see, to feel, to know, to understand, and 
to remember things as they really are. You and I have been endowed with a greater
capacity for obedience precisely for these reasons.*

*I testify that his intelligence is vastly superior in every field to the very 
brightest mortals in those fields and that his intellect in scope and truth far 
exceeds all human intellects. I thank him for encapsulating that exquisite mind 
in both perfect love and perfect humility. His brilliance is not the 
“catch-me-if-you-can” kind, but a pleading and patient, “Come, follow me.”*

  + Represent a real-world process programatically in order to evaluate statistical
  properties
  + Uses include:
    + Describing distributions (e.g., mean, variance, quantiles).
    + Evaluating point estimators.
    + Evaluating confidence intervals.
    + Investigating the properties and performance of testing hypothesis procedures.
    + Checking the finite-sample statistical properties of estimators and testing 
    procedures that have been motivated through asymptotics.
    + and many others...
  + Especially useful when theoretical derivations are unavailable, difficult, 
    or intractable.
