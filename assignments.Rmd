<summary>Assignment Checklist
</summary>

1. Setup GitHub repository through GitHub classroom (this is simply following a
link in the assignment page)
2. Copy the repository URL (make sure you are copying the SSH url, not the HTTPS
url)
3. Create a new RStudio project from Version Control (File -> New Project ->
Version Control)
    - This will create a new directory (folder) on your computer for that
    assignment
    - Make sure you know where your projects / directories are being saved
4. Begin working on the assignment
5. As you reach saving points, save your work and use the Git pane in RStudio to
commit your changes to `git`.
    - Make sure that each commit contains a commit message
    - **Do not** amend previous commit
6. Push your changes to GitHub using the Git pane in RStudio
7. Visit your GitHub repository in a web browser and ensure that your submitted
files are there
    - **If your files are not on GitHub they are not turned in**
8. Once your assignment has been graded, perform a Git Pull using the Git pane
in RStudio to pull `feedback.txt` into your local repository.
